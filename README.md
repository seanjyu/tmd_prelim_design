# Tuned Mass Damper Preliminary Design Web App
![readme_img](readme_img.PNG)

The following web app gives an approximate design for tuned mass dampers given a dynamic amplification factor (DAF) and building damping ratio. This app is based off the equations found in the textbook Structural Motion Engineering by J Connor and S Laflamme; and the paper â€œOptimum tuned-mass dampers for minimizing steady-state response of support-excited and damped systems" by H.-C. Tsai and G.-C Lin. 
The optimized design variables are the mass ratio ($\Big(\\frac{m_{damper}}{m_{building}}$), frequency ratio ($\Big(\\frac{f_{damper}}{f_{building}}\Big)$) and the Damping ratio of the damper ($(\\xi_{damper})$). 

A more in depth documentation as to how the design is calculated can be found in my blog:

The app is hosted on streamlit and can be accessed at this website:
